Given an array represented by an NxN matrix, write a method to rotate it to the right. Can you do this in place?

Example:

TestCase 1 ->  

Input:
[   1,  2,  3,
    4,  5,  6,
    7,  8,  9   ]

Output:
[   4,  1,  2,
    7,  5,  3,
    8,  9,  6   ]

TestCase 2 ->

Input:
[   1,  2,  3,  4,
    5,  6,  7,  8,
    9,  10, 11, 12,
    13, 14, 15, 16  ]

Output:
[   5,  1,  2,  3,
    9,  10, 6,  4,
    13, 11, 7,  8,
    14, 15, 16, 12  ]
